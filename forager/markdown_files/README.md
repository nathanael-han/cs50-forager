1.)	To run my website, start by transferring the folder named ‘forager’ into the CS50 IDE.
This folder contains all the files that comprise my website. Inside this folder are my
html files, an mp4 video, CSS stylesheets, and a javascript file. Also, nested inside the ‘forager’ folder
is another folder named ‘images’ which contains the picture files for my website (jpg, jpeg).

2.)	Next, enter into the forager directory in the CS50 IDE terminal (cd forager). Once in this
directory, type in ‘http-server’, and open the URL that appears in the terminal.

3.)	In the listing of files, select first.html.

4.)	This will bring you to the landing page of my website. On this page there is
a button that brings you to my main page.

On the main page I have a navigation bar, that links to three different ‘galleries’ entitled
plants, mushrooms, and ocean. Also on the main page is an image carousel; you can scroll
through the images by pressing the arrows.

Below this is a footer, which also contains navigation links. I also included a button
which toggles the background color when pressed.

The website is responsive, and rescales for mobile viewing.

In the plants, mushrooms, and ocean sections, I have a number of ‘wild edibles’ listed.
By clicking one of the cards, you’ll see some text describing each wild edible, as
well as its scientific name. The map on each page has a few markers – these demarcate
locations in New England where this wild edible can be found. By zooming in, you can
also then drag the Pegman icon to the location and scout out areas using Street View.
